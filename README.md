# Particle Swarm Optimisation
Contains all necessary resources required to execute PSO

## Introduction
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the bio-inspired algorithm that searches for an optimal solution in the solution space. It is different from other optimization algorithms in the sense that only the objective function is needed and it is not dependent on the gradient or any differential form of the objective
